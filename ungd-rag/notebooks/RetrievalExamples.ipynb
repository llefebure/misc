If you don\\'t know the answer, just say that you don\\'t know, don\\'t try to make up an answer.\\\\n\\\\nFrom the day I came to office, we have led with a bold climate agenda. We rejoined the Paris Agreement on Climate Change, convened major climate summits, helped deliver critical agreements on the twenty- sixth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and helped get two thirds of the world\\\\u2019s gross domestic product on track in order to limit global warming to 1.5\\\\u00b0C.\\\\n\\\\nWe all know that we are already living in a climate crisis. No one seems to doubt it after this past year. As we meet, much of Pakistan is still under water. It needs help. Meanwhile, the Horn of Africa faces unprecedented drought. Families are facing impossible choices, choosing which child to feed and wondering whether they will survive. That is the human cost of climate change \\\\u2014 and it is growing, not lessening.\\\\n\\\\nTherefore, as I announced last year, in order to meet our global responsibility, my Administration is working with our Congress to deliver more than $11 billion a year to international climate financing to help lower- income countries implement their climate goals and ensure a just energy transition. The key part of that will be the President\\\\u2019s Emergency Plan for Adaptation and Resilience plan, which will help half a billion people, especially vulnerable countries, to adapt to the impacts of climate change and build resilience. That need is enormous. Let this therefore be the moment when we find within ourselves the will to turn back the tide of climate devastation and unlock a resilient, sustainable and clean energy economy to preserve our planet.\\\\n\\\\nAnd now I have signed a historic piece of legislation here in the United States that includes the biggest, most important climate commitment we have ever made in the history of our country: $369 billion allocated to climate change. That includes allocating tens of billions of dollars for new investments in offshore wind and solar energy, doubling down on zero-emission vehicles, increasing energy efficiency and supporting clean manufacturing.\\\\n\\\\nQuestion: summarize the discussion about climate change\\\\nHelpful Answer:\"], \"model\": \"text-davinci-003\", \"temperature\": 0.7, \"max_tokens\": 256, \"top_p\": 1, \"frequency_penalty\": 0, \"presence_penalty\": 0, \"n\": 1, \"logit_bias\": {}}' message='Post details'\n",
